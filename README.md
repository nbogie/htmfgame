Incomplete implementation and simplification of the board game
by a Haskell beginner.  Look elsewhere for a proper version.

(This is just on github as a backup.)

Features:
=========
AI vs AI (though the player can tell the computer to move randomly or idiotically, at each step).

Very basic optional user control of player 1, with mouse.

Limitations:
============

AI is slow, and exceptionally stupid.  It is minimax, with no thought yet given to the static eval of a board.

Initial player placement is done at random, rather than played out interactively.
