Incomplete implementation and simplification of the board game
by a Haskell beginner.  Look elsewhere for a proper version.

(This is just on github as a backup.)

Limitations:
============

No user-play yet.  Just AI vs AI.

AI is very dumb.  It is minimax, with the roughest possible static eval.
No hex grid yet, just square grid.

Initial player placement is done at random, rather than played out interactively.
