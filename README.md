Incomplete implementation and simplification of the board game
by a Haskell beginner.  Look elsewhere for a proper version.

(This is just on github as a backup.)

Limitations:
============

No user-play yet.  Just AI vs AI (though the player can tell the computer to move intelligently or randomly, at each step).

AI is very dumb.  It is minimax, with the roughest possible static eval.

Initial player placement is done at random, rather than played out interactively.
